## ðŸ§ªProject3 - Ransomware Propagation and Payload

---

### ðŸŽ¯GOAL
- Crack SSH password
- Create a compression virus with the propagation of the ransomware worm
- Prepare the ransomware payload

### ðŸ§¨STEP1: Crack SSH password
- Cracking the victimâ€™s password by launching a dictionary attack
  - A file including the victimâ€™s personal information: /app/victim.dat
  - Automatic SSH and SFTP operation in Python: paramiko

### ðŸ§¨STEP2: Compression Virus with Ransomware Propagation
- Infected â€˜echoâ€™ shall
  - Keep the same size as the original â€˜echoâ€™
    - The original â€˜echoâ€™ shall be compressed
  - Contain the virus payload and the functionality of the original â€˜echoâ€™
  - Finish the execution of the payload before the end of the â€˜echoâ€™ execution
- The virus payload shall
  - Fetch a ransomware worm from the attack server
  - Execute the ransomware worm
- Requirements
  - The infection cannot leave any files except the infected â€˜echoâ€™ on the victim 
container
  - The last 512 bytes of the infected â€˜echoâ€™ should be the signature generated by Dilithium3 algorithm
  - The size of infected â€˜echoâ€™ should be identical to the original one

### ðŸ§¨STEP3: Ransomware Payload
- Two major actions
  - Encrypting all picture files with jpg subtype in /app/Pictures at the victim using AES
  - Show a graph indicating a message requesting ransom (check the banner file for the source)
